# Introduction to PMEM-CSI for Kubernetes

**Note: This is Alpha code and not production ready.**

Intel PMEM-CSI is a [CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec)
storage driver for container orchestrators like
Kubernetes. It makes local persistent memory
([PMEM](https://pmem.io/)) available as a filesystem volume to
container applications. It can currently utilize non-volatile memory
devices that can be controlled via the [libndctl utility
library](https://github.com/pmem/ndctl). In this readme, we use
*persistent memory* to refer to a non-volatile dual in-line memory
module (NVDIMM).

The [v0.7.0 release](https://github.com/intel/pmem-csi/releases/latest)
is the latest feature release and is [regularly updated](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#release-management) with newer base images
and bug fixes. Older versions are no longer supported.

Documentation is part of the source code for each release and also
available in rendered form for easier reading:
- [latest documentation, in development](https://intel.github.io/pmem-csi/latest/)
- [latest 0.7.x release](https://intel.github.io/pmem-csi/0.7/)

## Supported Kubernetes versions

PMEM-CSI implements the CSI specification version 1.x, which is only
supported by Kubernetes versions >= v1.13. The following table
summarizes the status of support for PMEM-CSI on different Kubernetes
versions:

| Kubernetes version | Required alpha feature gates   | Support status
|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------
| 1.13               | CSINodeInfo, CSIDriverRegistry,<br>CSIBlockVolume</br>| unsupported <sup>1</sup>
| 1.14               |                                | unsupported <sup>2</sup>
| 1.15               | CSIInlineVolume                | unsupported <sup>3</sup>
| 1.16               |                                | unsupported <sup>4</sup>
| 1.17               |                                | supported
| 1.18               |                                | supported
| 1.19               |                                | supported

<sup>1</sup> Several relevant features are only available in alpha
quality in Kubernetes 1.13 and the combination of skip attach and
block volumes is completely broken, with [the
fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79920) only being
available in later versions. The external-provisioner v1.0.1 for
Kubernetes 1.13 lacks the `--strict-topology` flag and therefore late
binding is unreliable. It's also a release that is not supported
officially by upstream anymore.

<sup>2</sup> Lacks support for ephemeral inline volumes.
Not supported officially by upstream anymore.

<sup>3</sup> Not supported officially by upstream anymore.

<sup>4</sup> No longer supported by current
[external-provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/)
2.0.0 because support for the v1beta CSI APIs was removed. Also not
supported officially by upstream anymore.
